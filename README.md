# Mégra Visualizer

A simple, browser-based visualizer for the Mégra language.

## Requirements 

You need `node.js` and `npm` installed on your system to run this (and a browser, of course).

For instructions, see: https://nodejs.org/en/download

On Linux, you can also use your distribution's package manager.

## Build & Run

To build, run `npm install && cd web && npm install`.

Now, in the root folder, you can start the app using `node megra_visualizer.js` and see the result in the
browser (`http://localhost:8081`).
